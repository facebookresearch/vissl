## Run everything on 1 gpu `low_resource_1gpu_train_wrapper.sh`

If you have a configuration file (any vissl compatible file) that you want to run on 1-gpu only (for example: train SimCLR on 1 gpu, etc), you don't need to modify the config file. You can simple achieve this by using the `low_resource_1gpu_train_wrapper.sh` script. An example usage:

```bash
cd $HOME/vissl
./dev/low_resource_1gpu_train_wrapper.sh config=test/integration_test/quick_swav
```

## Running quick tests `run_quick_tests.sh`

To run trainings (SimCLR, SwAV, PIRL etc.) for a few iterations, we provide `run_quick_tests.sh`. This requires 1 or 2 gpus.

## Running code on slurm with `dev/launch_slurm.sh`
Please see the script `dev/launch_slurm.sh` for running the code on slurm cluster for training purposes.

## Practices for coding quality

For every PR, we run/mandate a few checks before code is ready for review. The checks are:
1. **flake8**: We enforce coding style per file with defined flake8 rules. flake8 is a checker only and doesn't format code.
2. **black**: We format the code using black8
3. **isort**: We check that imports are properly sorted https://pypi.org/project/isort/. See `setup.cfg` for the settings.

In order to format code before code review, there are 2 options:

### Option 1: use `dev/linter.sh`

Run "./dev/linter.sh" at the project root before you commit. This will run isort, black and flake8 formatting.

### Option 2: use `.pre-commit-config`

We provide pre-commit hooks so as you build and commit (locally or github), the code formatting will be automatically run.
You need to run `pre-commit install` once to enable this.

Read the doc https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2018/06/21/precommits-using-black-and-flake8/ for how all the components operate and the pipeline/steps involved.
