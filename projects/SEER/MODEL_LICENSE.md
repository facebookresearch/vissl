<h2 align="center"> SEER LICENSE AGREEMENT </h2>

This License Agreement (as may be amended in accordance with this License Agreement, “**License**”), between you (“**Licensee**” or “**you**”) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (“**Meta**” or “**we**”) governs your use of any computer program, algorithm, source code, object code, or software that is made available by Meta under this License (“**Software**”) and any specifications, manuals, documentation, and other written information provided by Meta related to the Software (“**Documentation**”).  The terms of this license become effective upon your use of the Software and will remain effective unless terminated as set forth in this agreement.

**By clicking “I Accept” below or by using the Software, you agree to the terms of this License.  If you do not agree to this License, then you do not have any rights to use the Software or Documentation (collectively, the “Software Products”), and you must immediately cease using the Software Products.**

1. **LICENSE GRANT**

Subject to your compliance with the Documentation and Sections 2, 3, and 5, Meta grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, royalty free and limited license to reproduce, distribute, and create derivative works of the Software solely for your non-commercial research purposes.  The foregoing license is personal to you, and you may not assign or sublicense this License or any other rights or obligations under this License without Meta’s prior written consent; any such assignment or sublicense will be void and will automatically and immediately terminate this License.

META’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ITS SUBJECT MATTER WILL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100).

6. **TERMINATION; SURVIVAL**

     a.       This License will automatically terminate upon any breach by you of the terms of this License.

   The Software Products may contain third-party software or other components (including free and open source software) (all of the foregoing, “**Third Party Materials**”), which are subject to the license terms of the respective third-party licensors.  Your dealings or correspondence with third parties and your use of or interaction with any Third Party Materials are solely between you and the third party.

9. **APPLICABLE LAW; DISPUTE RESOLUTION**

   This License will be governed and construed under the laws of the State of California without regard to conflicts of law provisions.  Any suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this License will be brought in the federal or state courts, as applicable, in San Mateo County, California, and each party irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts.

10. **MISCELLANEOUS**

    If any provision or part of a provision of this License is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severed from this License, and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.  The failure of Meta to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this License will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. This License does not confer any third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.  This License, together with the Documentation, contains the entire understanding between you and Meta regarding the subject matter of this License, and supersedes all other written or oral agreements and understandings between you and Meta regarding such subject matter.  No change or addition to any provision of this License will be binding unless it is in writing and signed by an authorized representative of both you and Meta.
