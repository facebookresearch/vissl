# When to do version bump:
#   - version bump is NOT required if the new keys are being added to the defaults.yaml
#   - version bump IS required when the existing keys are being changed leading to
#     potential backward incompatibility. Example: deprecation of existing keys,
#     existing keys behavior changes etc.
# To bump version:
#     1. Increment LATEST_CFG_VERSION in this file
#     2. Increment the VERSION in defaults.yaml file.
#     2. Add a proper version converter in this file.
