    Sets up and executes training workflow per machine.

    Args:
        cfg (AttrDict): user specified input config that has optimizer, loss, meters etc
                        settings relevant to the training
        dist_run_id (str): For multi-gpu training with PyTorch, we have to specify
                           how the gpus are going to rendezvous. This requires specifying
                           the communication method: file, tcp and the unique rendezvous
                           run_id that is specific to 1 run.
                           We recommend:
                                1) for 1node: use init_method=tcp and run_id=auto
                                2) for multi-node, use init_method=tcp and specify
                                run_id={master_node}:{port}
        checkpoint_path (str): if the training is being resumed from a checkpoint, path to
                          the checkpoint. The tools/run_distributed_engines.py automatically
                          looks for the checkpoint in the checkpoint directory.
        checkpoint_folder (str): what directory to use for checkpointing. The
                          tools/run_distributed_engines.py creates the directory based on user
                          input in the yaml config file.
        local_rank (int): id of the current device on the machine. If using gpus,
                        local_rank = gpu number on the current machine
        node_id (int): id of the current machine. starts from 0. valid for multi-gpu
        hook_generator (Callable): The utility function that prepares all the hoooks that will
                         be used in training based on user selection. Some basic hooks are used
                         by default.
